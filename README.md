Introduction
We are very much aware that media consumption patterns influence multiple aspects including preferences and behavior. However, the relation of specific factors to breaking the fourth wall, such as romance themes in the narrative, is unknown. I would like to take time to look at the relationship between romance and the occurrence of breaking the fourth wall in the show Wizards of Waverly Place created by Disney Channel.
	Media consumption is a key part of modern day culture. It creates narrative and perceptions. In this regard, the theme of romance and its relationship to techniques based on narratives, such as breaking the fourth wall can provide insight into the trends of storytelling. 
	The dataset contains 110 observations covering various different variables related to media, elements of narratives, and consumption behaviors. The primary variables that I will be focusing on are romance themes (binary) and breaking the fourth wall (binary). I used a chi-squared test to investigate how the two categorical variables are associated with one another.
	The analysis reveals that there is an observable relationship between romance and the fourth wall. A chi-squared test does in fact indicate that narratives with romance themes are more likely to break the fourth wall than if romance was not present.
	These findings suggest that romance being included in narratives might impact the technique of the said narrative, such as breaking the fourth wall to entertain the audience.

Data and Methods
	The dataset includes 110 observations with variables that measure multiple different factors related to media consumption, television elements, and more.
		The key variables are:
		Romance - binary variable that indicates whether romance themes are present
		Fourth Wall - binary variable that indicates whether the fourth wall is broken

The variable romance is a binary variable and 1 means that romance is present and 0 means that romance is not present.
The variable fourth wall is also a binary variable and 1 means that the fourth wall is broken and 0 means that the fourth wall is not broken.
	To answer the research question, I conducted a chi-square test to analyze the relationship between romance themes and breaking the fourth wall.

Research Question: Is there a relationship between romance and breaking the fourth wall?
Null Hypothesis: There is no relationship between romance and breaking the fourth wall.
Research Hypothesis: There is a relationship between romance and breaking the fourth wall.

 Results

	The chi-squared test results indicate that there is a statistically significant relationship between romance and breaking the fourth wall. Among narratives with romance themes, 4.3% included breaking the fourth wall. Among narratives without romance themes, 6.2% included breaking the fourth wall. 
	The observations are independent since the narrative observation is unique for each. All cells have expected frequencies greater than 5, which fulfills the assumption of the chi-squared test.

Discussion
The analysis proves that there is a significant relationship between romance and the fourth wall being broken. Narratives without themes of romance are more likely to break the fourth wall than those without romance themes. 
The results suggest that romance themes being present may influence techniques used in the narrative. 
The study is limited by the sample size and binary operationalization of the variables. An improved future research study could include more variables. 
The analysis allows for other questions to be asked such as if the genre of romance has an impact on the fourth wall breaking. For example, different genres can be comedy or drama. 
Conducting this research has been an interesting task. I enjoyed watched the television show Wizards of Waverly Place and seeing how the makers of the show used different variables for the purpose of entertainment.
